<h1> COLLEGE ADMISSIONS PREDICTOR RESULTS </H1>
<h3> Correct for 92% of all students! Written by professionals! </h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Verdict: Denied </h2>
The neural network has carefully calculated your scores 
and it regrets to inform you that it is most likely that your college of choice would not offer you admission, or a position on one of our alternate lists. The applicant pool is particularly strong
 each year that goes by, and in the meantime, you can help yourself by writing better college essays or by getting smarter, i.e not making mistakes on your tests, circling the correct bubble, going on
  Google to find out how to increase your IQ by 10 points.
 <br> <br>
 (And if that fails, remember that a rejection from college isn't the end of the world. There are much worse things out there, including being rescinded after bragging about rigging the elections.)
<br> <br>
 A final message: although this prediction is 92% accurate, do remember that numbers are not infallible. As a student with a unique uprising and personality,
  it's hard to quantify such qualities in numbers. Your SAT scores, however, were docked by 200 points in this prediction if you were Asian.
 
<p><h3> HOW THIS WORKS: </h3></p>
<p>With the ever expanding use of artificial intelligence in our community at the present moment,
 the college predictor app takes full advantage of this, using data sets of thousands of seniors from Phillips Exeter Academy [as provided by Naviance] and
  the listed criteria above as the the variables. Then, the College Admissions Predictor finds a pattern between success and failure with an artificial neural network.
   Once a good relationship can be found, it compares you to these past students and predicts your likelihood.
   <br><br> The success of the predictor not only comes from the large training data given, but also from a great understanding
    of the college process passed from multiple college counselors and admission officers.
    <br><br>
    As the influential advisor Dr. D Naidaggen once said, "You could have a 10.9 GPA and be the School President, and <b> still </b> get rejected by every Ivy League School."
